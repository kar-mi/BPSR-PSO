 # BSPR-PSO Client

 This project consists of a single application, `pso_client.exe`, which is a user interface for displaying data. The backend functionality is now fully integrated into the client, so there is no longer a separate server application to run.

 ## Prerequisites

 Before running the application, you must install **Npcap**. The application requires this network packet capture driver to function correctly.

 Find and run `npcap-1.83.exe` from this directory.

 Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

 ## How to Run the Application

 You will only need to run the `pso_client.exe` from the command line.

 1. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell in the directory containing the files.

 2. Execute the following command to start the client:

    ```
    .\pso_client.exe
    ```
